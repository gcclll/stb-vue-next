   * can lead to confusing infinite loops.
   * The allowed cases are component update functions and watch callbacks.
   * Component update functions may update child component props, which in turn
   * trigger flush: "pre" watch callbacks that mutates state that the parent

   * triggers itself again, it's likely intentional and it is the user's
   * responsibility to perform recursive state mutation that eventually
